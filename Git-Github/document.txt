Git/Github
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create github account and install git locallay on your laptop/pc

next we have to configure git  by using below commands
we have to configure in root directory
git config --global user.name "Naveen Bupati"

--to configure username

git config --global user.email "naveenbupati22@gmail.com"

--to configure email

git config  --list to come out vim editor from it we should should use :q enter 

git clone--link to clone a repo from github remote repo to local repo

cd change directory to that folder

ls --list of files to check

ls -a to check to hidden files we use

to check the status of code we use --git status

when we add new file git changes it status as untrackd file untill it get added and commit

there are four types of git status we can see

1.untracked--new files that git doesn't yet track
2.modified -- changed but not commited
3.staged -- when file is added but not commited is known as staged file is ready to be committed
4.unmodified--after commiting file it goes to  unchanged no changes are made

git add-- it adds new and changed files from our woking directory to git staging area
git add filename and add only one file
git add. add all files present in folder

git commit -m "added-new-file"

git push origin main
--push command is uesd to upload local repo content to remote repo

to copy from one folder to another folder using command
cp -r ./HTML ./Module1
cp -r sourcepath to destination path


 (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
 
 git push -u origin master
Permission to (repo.git) denied
fatal unable to access the requested url returned error 403

for this error if we have multiple accounts on github 
our git will store previous github crdentials in windows crdentials manager

we to check in that and remove old credentials

*if we want to create a folder and push code from local-machine to remote github follow below

create folder
add files 
and go to that directory or folder using cd command

1. git init --it will initializes an empty repository in local-machine
2. now git add . and git commit -m "add"
3. now add the remote origin link ----git remote add origin "link" link refers to create a new repo in
   github and add the url here
4. git remote-v ---to check the remote repo added or not
5. git branch ---to check branch name 
6. git branch -M main to change from amster to main
7. git push -u origin main origin --refers to name of the remote repository
8. here -u means upstream setting for next push purpose for next time if we push we use just "git push"  instead of ---git push origin main 


 
Git branch
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1.to check branch git branch
2.to create new brnach git branch [new-branch-name] 
3.to create a new branch and checkout to it git checkout -b [new-brnach-name]
4.to checkout from one branch to another branch use git checkout [branch-name]
5.to merge or to add two branches they are two ways raise pull requests in github (or) use git merge [branch-name] 
6.to see differnces we use git diff [branch-name]
7. git pull ---comand is to download the repos from github to local means remote repo to local repo
8.git conflicts are the conflits that arises when there is a change in samefile or in a same line of a code to resolve git conflicts developer need to review the code and decidewhic is to be there in code.
9. to delete branch git branch -d [brnach-name]


By using vs code
--------------------------------------------------------
1.by using vs-code we can commit and push directly to github without using any commands by source control in vs-code
2.if we want to create any new branch from vs code we can create using branch name in below vs code
