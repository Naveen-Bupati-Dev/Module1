Git/Github
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*create github account and install git locallay on your laptop/pc

next we have to configure git  by using below commands
we have to configure in root directory
git config --global user.name "Naveen Bupati"

--to configure username

git config --global user.email "naveenbupati22@gmail.com"

--to configure email

git config  --list to come out vim editor from it we should should use :q enter 

git clone--link to clone a repo from github remote repo to local repo

cd change directory to that folder

ls --list of files to check

ls -a to check to hidden files we use

to check the status of code we use --git status

when we add new file git changes it status as untrackd file untill it get added and commit

there are four types of git status we can see

1.untracked--new files that git doesn't yet track
2.modified -- changed but not commited
3.staged -- when file is added but not commited is known as staged file is ready to be committed
4.unmodified--after commiting file it goes to  unchanged no changes are made

git add-- it adds new and changed files from our woking directory to git staging area
git add filename and add only one file
git add. add all files present in folder

git commit -m "added-new-file"

git push origin main
--push command is uesd to upload local repo content to remote repo

to copy from one folder to another folder using command
cp -r ./HTML ./Module1
cp -r sourcepath to destination path


 (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
 
 git push -u origin master
Permission to (repo.git) denied
fatal unable to access the requested url returned error 403

for this error if we have multiple accounts on github 
our git will store previous github crdentials in windows crdentials manager

we to check in that and remove old credentials...
